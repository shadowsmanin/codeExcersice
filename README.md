# Code Portfolio
This is a public repository to display my coding style, and how I might go about trying to solve some problems!

There are several folders in here related to my practice with multiple different problems and languages. If anyone would like, I can also send them some examples of more complicated programs I have done for my game SpaceSlam as well.
